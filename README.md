# Smart-Home-Arduino

The projects consists in a fire alarm.
The fire alarm can be activated entering a code on a keypad. If the temperature in the room is above 45 degrees celsius the alarm goes on and on a keypad the message "Evacuate" is displayed.
You can deactivate the alarm by typing the code.
I used a temperature sensor, keypad, LCD 16x2, 3 resistors, Arduino UNO R3 board and a breadboard. 
I made a simulation in tinkercad and is also available.
